# JPianoTiles

This is my first android project, it is a single-player mobile game used to learn development with Android Studio, libGDX, Git, GitHub and Genymotion.

# Motivation

Since I have finished my first information technology university I was thinking to become a developer, however, I used to work too much and now I have got a free time to develop this dream.

# Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See Installation for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

# Prerequisites

First of all, you should be able to download this entire project code available on GitHub.

To be able to run this game you need to have installed Android Studio (at least 2.3) with an AVD configured. 

A recent version of the Android SDK (at least API 23). 

The libGDX library (version 1.9.8 or compatible).

Optional: You can also run it on your own android mobile device using a USB cable and even exporting a .apk file.

# Installation

First, clone the project from Github:

git clone git@github.com:julianotech/JPianoTiles.git

Then, in Android Studio:

Select Import project (Eclipse, ADT, Gradle, etc.) in the Welcome Screen, go find the repository you just cloned, and click OK.
Once the project is open, click on Sync Project with Gradle Files in the main toolbar (or navigate to Tools -> Android in the application menu and select the same option).

Once you see a BUILD SUCCESSFUL notice in the Gradle Console, your environment should be ready to build and run the project.

# Tests

I have realized tests on Android Visual Studio using AVD for Nexus API 27 by Google Inc.
Also, looking to improving the  AVD performance using Genymotion virtual devices, running a Samsung Galaxy S6 7.1.0 - API 25 with successful.

# Built With
