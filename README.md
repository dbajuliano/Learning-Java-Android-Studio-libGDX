# :snake: jsnake

This is my second android project, it is a single-player mobile game used to learn how to develop on Android Studio with libGDX.

# ‚ù§Ô∏è Motivation

Since I have finished my first information technology university I am thinking to become a developer, however, I used to work too much and now I have got a free time to develop this dream.

# ‚ö†Ô∏è Prerequisites

These requirements will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See Installation for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

Make sure you are able to download this entire project code available on GitHub.

To be able to run this game you need to have installed Android Studio (at least 2.3) with an AVD configured. 

A recent version of the Android SDK (at least API 19). 

The libGDX library (version 1.9.8 or compatible).

Oracle Java Development Kit ("JDK")

Optional: You can also run it on your own android mobile device using a USB cable and even exporting a .apk file.

# üíæ Installation

After get the environment installed and configured, clone the project from Github:
```
git clone git@github.com:julianotech/jsnake.git
```
Then, in Android Studio:

Select Import project (Eclipse, ADT, Gradle, etc.) in the Welcome Screen, go find the repository you just cloned, and click OK.
Once the project is open, your environment should be ready to build and run the project.

# ‚òëÔ∏è Tests

I have tested on Android Studio using AVD for Nexus API 27 by Google Inc.

Looking to improve the AVD performance I have used Genymotion virtual devices to emulate a Samsung Galaxy S6 7.1.0 - API 25 with successful.
